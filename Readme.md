# Analyze A/B test results project

Project 4 in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

## Project description

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a **new web page** in order to try and increase the number of users who *convert*, meaning the number of users who decide to *pay* for the company's product. My goal was to help the company understand if they should *implement* this new page, *keep* the old page, or perhaps *run the experiment longer* to make their decision.

- All results from different analyses are correctly interpreted.

*Correct Values for All Statistical Results*

- For all numeric values, you should provide the correct results of the analysis.
